## Playing the game
* Use the arrow keys to move around
* Reaching the river gains a point
* Getting hit by an enemy loses a point
* Enemies get faster the more points you get
* Step off the side of the board to flip round to the back. Use this to avoid enemies, but beware your left and right are reversed, making movement trickier.

## Version 1.0.1

### Release Notes
Updates to address issues with first submission:
* Added this readme with instructions.
* Updated code to use UPPERCASE for constants as per Udacity Style Guide
